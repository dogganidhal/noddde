# @noddde/core

## 1.0.0-rc.1

### Minor Changes

- 69b9817: Add `KafkaEventBus.warmup()` / `warmupOnConnect` for Kafka cold-start latency, and a new `EventIdempotencyStore` + `withIdempotency()` primitive (`@noddde/core`) for deduplicating event handler invocations under Kafka/RabbitMQ at-least-once redelivery, with an in-memory implementation in `@noddde/engine` and durable table-backed implementations in `@noddde/typeorm`, `@noddde/drizzle`, and `@noddde/prisma`.

  `@noddde/nats` gets a permanent benchmark test (no API change) documenting that per-subscription inbox-subject memory is negligible at scale — no code change was needed after measuring against a real broker.

- 54a763d: Add an optional per-saga `atomicity` field and the `SagaAtomicity` type (`"atomic" | "best-effort"`) to saga definitions.

  `atomicity` is a declarative field on `defineSaga` / the `Saga` interface; `defineSaga` remains a pure identity function and does not read, validate, or default it. The engine's `SagaExecutor` consumes the field, treating an absent value as `"atomic"` (today's behavior), so existing sagas are unaffected.

## 1.0.0-rc.0

### Major Changes

- e03a054: First release candidate for v1.0.0.

  This kicks off the pre-release cycle ahead of the stable v1.0.0 release. The public API surface is now considered stable; subsequent `rc` builds will focus on stabilization, documentation, and adapter robustness based on community feedback.

  Highlights since 0.3.9:

  - **Adapters** — pg/mysql portability fixes across Drizzle/Prisma/TypeORM (timestamp encoding, advisory-lock return shapes, optimistic-concurrency detection on mysql2). NATS push consumers now declare an explicit `deliverTo` inbox (required by NATS Server >= 2.10). Kafka `connect()` waits for `GROUP_JOIN` so producers can't publish into the consumer's not-yet-joined window.
  - **Build output** — all packages now ship dual CJS and ESM bundles.
  - **Type system** — stress-tested across core and engine; results captured in `specs/reports/type-perf.md`.
  - **Docs** — full pre-GA audit pass across the documentation site (API drift, naming, broken links, structure).
  - **Integration testing** — adapter integration test suite with testcontainers + path-filtered CI lane.

## 0.3.9

### Patch Changes

- 9a3e3b7: build: emit dual CJS + ESM for all packages via tsup
